# Multiple-linear-regression
This is a repository for my big data class's multiple linear regression assignments. The tasks are:
  * create a scatter plot for each independent variable and dependent variable, 
  * build a linear regression model for each independent variable and dependent variable, 
  * predict some value using that model, and 
  * create multiple linear regression models.

The data for these assignments is in the Excel file "Datareg.xlsx," and the tasks are in the PowerPoint file "Soal Latihan.pptx."

You are welcome to use my repo for practice or anything else.
